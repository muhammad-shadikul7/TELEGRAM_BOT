# TELEGRAM_BOT
This Python code implements a simple AI assistant that can answer questions and provide search results using the Bing API. The assistant can be controlled using voice commands, and it is able to understand and respond to natural language queries.

To use the assistant, simply run the ai_assistant.py script in a terminal. The assistant will then start listening for voice commands. To ask a question, simply speak naturally into the microphone. The assistant will then process your query and provide you with an answer.

The assistant can also be used to perform web searches. To do this, simply speak the query that you want to search for. The assistant will then open a web browser and display the search results.

The AI Assistant is still under development, but it is already capable of performing a variety of tasks. It can be used to answer questions about current events, translate languages, generate creative text formats, and much more.

Here are some examples of how to use the AI Assistant:

To ask a question, say "What is the capital of France?"
To perform a web search, say "Search for the weather forecast for tomorrow."
To translate a sentence, say "Translate the sentence 'I love you' into Spanish."
To generate a creative text format, say "Generate a poem about a cat."
The AI Assistant is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a variety of tasks. It is still under development, but it is already capable of providing users with a valuable service.

I hope this description is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
